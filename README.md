# ProductLine

This is a production tracker program intended for use by a factory that produces media players. At the time of writing, I am a Junior in college at Florida Gulf Coast University. This program is specifically for an Object Oriented Programming assignment, and is a semester long project that will continue to receive updates as time goes on.

## History
9/10/2019 This project started out as a GUI with no data base attached or CSS. 
9/28/2019 The project now has a CSS file to style the GUI and a data base attached.
11/9/2019 The project now has integreated table views and database functionality to record progress.


## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
Key concepts I used in this project are establishing data bases with H2, creating a file path for said data base, inserting items into the data base using SQL and CSS to create a design for the GUI.
